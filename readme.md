WHAT IS THIS?
This is my final project for a Beginner Javascript course I took at www.geekwiseacademy.com.

WHAT DOES IT DO?
• This movie app contains a preset movie library and allows you to check out and return movies.
• To simulate the concept that days have passed between movie check out and return, a random number of days gets assigned to each movie being returned.
• Allows you to add new movies to the library.
• Resorts the library alphabetically every time a new movie is added.
• Provides authentication for form fields and alerts the user to incorrectly entered or omitted information.
