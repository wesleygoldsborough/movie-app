<h1>Movie App</h1>

<h3>WHAT IS THIS?</h3>
<p>This is my final project for a Beginner Javascript course I took at www.geekwiseacademy.com.</p>

<h3>WHAT DOES IT DO?</h3>
<ul>
<li>This movie app contains a preset movie library and allows you to check out and return movies.</li>
<li>To simulate the concept that days have passed between movie check out and return, a random number of days gets assigned to each movie being returned.</li>
<li>Allows you to add new movies to the library.</li>
<li>Resorts the library alphabetically every time a new movie is added.</li>
<li>Provides authentication for form fields and alerts the user to incorrectly entered or omitted information.</li>
</ul>
